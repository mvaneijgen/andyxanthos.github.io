I've been wanting to start a development focused blog for awhile now. With all the code I've been writing, I've grown to miss producing more free-form work like I did in school. This blog offers me an opportunity to improve my web dev skills and practice writing.

Alongside my editorial pieces, I have started work a good number of web development tutorials. In fact, as of today, I've started work on a tutorial for those interested in creating a blog like mine, using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. There are several Javascript related guides in the works as well, including one about jQuery selectors. As I develop more guides, I will also update the styling to make the site easier to navigate.

As for design, I don't consider this blog to be nearly finished. That said, I was so excited to write some content that I just had to make a post. I will continue to work on a suitable, effect design over the coming weeks. Obviously, any constructive criticism is welcomed. Hell, I'll welcome the nonconstructive stuff too.

More about me...
====================

I'm 23. I started studying programming about 6 months ago and decided to focus my efforts on web development about 2 months after that. Furthermore, I knew I wanted to focus on JavaScript programming. As of now, I am primarily experienced with front-end development tools like HTML, Sass, jQuery, Jekyll, and JavaScript. However, full stack development is my eventual goal.
