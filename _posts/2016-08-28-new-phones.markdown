Well, it happened again. Just a few days ago I broke yet another Samsung phone, the Note 5 that I bought only a few months ago. While I partially blame my own clumsiness each time, I don't understand why manufacturers continue to produce phones with glass exteriors.

People drop things. That's the reality of it. It's rare to meet someone who hasn't cracked a smart phone screen or two. So why is it that with each development cycle, manufacturers seem to design their devices in an increasingly fragile way?

Frustrated, I began my search for a replacement.

My Options
===================

After searching around for a little while and deciding on a $400 budget, I narrowed my focus on three options:

- OnePlus 3 ($400)
- ZTE Axon 7 ($400)
- Huawei Honor 5x ($300)

The OnePlus 3 immediately stood out to me. Not only does it have the best specs of the bunch with 6GB of RAM, 64 GB internal storage, and a SnapDragon 820 processor, it also boasts some of the most stunning design of the bunch. Plus, with OnePlus' new Dash Charger, the battery can go from 0-100% in just over an hour under heavy use. So, if the 3 is as great as I'm saying it is, why would I even consider anything else?

ZTE Axon 7
-----------

The ZTE Axon 7 has one of the best smartphone cameras on the market. Camera quality is extremely important to me as I love to take and edit photos on the go, without always lugging my DSLR around. The Axon 7 has a 21mp rear camera that is more than capable of capturing high quality video and photo.
