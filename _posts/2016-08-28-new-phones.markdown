Well, it happened again. Just a few days ago I broke yet another Samsung phone, the Note 5 that I bought only a few months ago. While I partially blame my own clumsiness each time, I don't understand why manufacturers continue to produce phones with glass exteriors.

People drop things. That's the reality of it. It's rare to meet someone who hasn't cracked a smart phone screen or two. So why is it that with each development cycle, manufacturers seem to design their devices in an increasingly fragile way?

Frustrated, I began my search for a replacement.

My Options
===================

After searching around for a little while and deciding on a $400 budget, I narrowed my focus on three options:

- OnePlus 3 ($400)
- ZTE Axon 7 ($400)
- Huawei Honor 5x ($300)
